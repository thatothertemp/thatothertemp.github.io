					<h2>What is TEDxNMIMSShirpur?</h2>
					<p>Technology, for long, was regarded as a independent field
					which introduced new innovations. In 1984, Richard Wurman
					felt a movement wherein technology overtook the way we
					felt and experienced entertainment and design. He set out
					to host the first TED(Technology Entertainment Design)
					conference which oversaw groundbreaking crossovers such
					Philips and Sony's demo of CD, Apple Macintosh, among
					others. Subsequently, as the conference blew up, TED
					biologically broadened it's horizons to include scientists,
					philosphers; anyone, who had an idea worth sharing.
					<br>
					This was a special event that distributed knowledge first
					hand, not a journalist's outlook. As TED was always at the
					cutting edge of technology, it really took advantage of
					internet's ability to reach a far greater audience. Today,
					TED boasts of a myraid of conferences held around the world,
					varying in topics, speakers and audience; they all strive for
					knowledge from the freshest sources.
					<br>
					TEDx is one of the many initiaves undertaken by TED. It
					recognizes the limitation of TED to give a platform to
					everyone and global aspect of the same. Through TEDx, TED 
					appoints curators around the world that are given the authority
 					to host an independent TED like event within guidelines which
					reenforce the quality TED is known for. TEDx have grown to be
					appreciated around the world because they are an amalagamation
					of TED's platform with the ideas of their appointed curator 
					which creates a unique platform of itself.
