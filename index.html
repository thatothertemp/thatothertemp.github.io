								<h2>TEDxNMIMSShirpur</h2>
								<p>TED, is an organization that promotes “ideas worth sharing” and,
								lends its name and support to TEDx, a series of conferences
								on urban futures held in several cities and organizations around the world.
								<br>
								<br>
								TED popularized as a metaculture that brought together varied people in
								varied job roles, all united by a zest of learning first, and sharing.
								With growth, TED started bringing this annual platform to our local institutions
								through TEDx, an independently organized TED event that sustains it's core values.
								<br>
								<br>
								TEDx at NMIMSShirpur is the inception of our curator, Akash Agarwal, who believed
								in his fellows in sharing the zest for learning as he fosters it too.
								As a team here, at TEDxNMIMSShirpur, we always strive for ideas that need a platform
								as a showcase of originality and professionalism.
								<br>
								<br>
								In 2018, we return with an aggresive team, thought provoking speakers and, an overall delight
								for your mind.
								<br>
								<br>
								For 2018, our theme is "Knocking Opportunities".</p>
